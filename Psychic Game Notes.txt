Project: Psychic Game

Notes: 
	I have at least one thing very noticeably wrong with the game.
I cssed some styles and it all seemed to work fine until I added the reset.css file.

When you open the game in the browser, it looks like how I styled it.  When a key is
pressed, then the game box shifts into a different size. I removed the reset.css file,
but the problem stayed, however, the box doesn't get as small.

If I re-link the reset.css the problem gets worse, the game box shrinks more. To
minimize the error I have removed the reset.css link from the index.html file.
